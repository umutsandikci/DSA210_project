# Project Proposal: Analyzing Spending Habits Based on Google Maps Location Data
This project aims to analyze how travel distances, frequently visited locations and new explorations affect my spending habbits. By combining Google Maps location data and my daily sepending log, I will analyze whether more travelling leads to spending more and identify frequent spending locations.

## Collection of data
**Location data ->** Google Takeout location history\
**Spending data ->** Manually collect daily expenses. (Date, Amount, Category, Location, Payment Method)
